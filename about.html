	<h3> About </h3> 

		<p> This website is about web design created by Emma Roman as a student project for ARTD 245: Web Design at <a href="https://www.northcentralcollege.edu/" target="_blank">North Central College</a> in Naperville, IL, in 2024. All the text comes from the following articles located on the Dribbble website. All the images were created by me using Photoshop. The website has been created using HTML and CSS in Dreamweaver.

<p> Students were directed to design and develop a visually pleasing, interactive website with multiple HTML pages, navigation connecting all the pages, featuring a cohesive color scheme, a clear visual hierarchy, a balanced layout, exciting visuals, and text. The goal is to learn how to code/develop an interactive website by applying design principles.
